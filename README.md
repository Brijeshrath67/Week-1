# Week-1
â€œWeek 1 milestone for the Sustainable Agriculture project â€“ includes dataset exploration, initial data preprocessing, and preliminary analysis for building sustainable farming insights.


# ðŸŒ± Sustainable Agriculture Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing crop production data to extract meaningful insights that can help in building sustainable farming solutions.

## ðŸ“Œ Week 1 Progress (30%)

âœ… In this week, we focused on **initial data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Description
- Source: Crop production dataset (`crop_production.csv`)
- Contains information on crop production over different years, states, and crop types.
- Key columns: `State_Name`, `District_Name`, `Crop`, `Area`, `Production`, `Year`

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing values (`NaN` in production/area).
- Dropped duplicate rows.
- Handled zero or invalid values.
- Saved the cleaned dataset as: `crop_yield_cleaned.csv`

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Yield distribution visualization  
- Top 10 crops by total production  
- Production trend over the years
